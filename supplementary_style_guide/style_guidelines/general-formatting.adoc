[[date-formats]]
== Date formats

Follow _The IBM Style Guide_  guidance of _day Month year_ for date formats, for example, 3 October 2019.

When the format _day Month year_ causes a presentation or clarity issue, use _Month day, year_ (for example, October 3, 2019) instead.


[[user-replaced-values]]
== User-replaced values

A _user-replaced value_, also known as a replaceable or variable value, is a value that the user must replace with a value that is relevant for their situation. User-replaced values are often found in places such as code blocks, file paths, and commands.

Use descriptive names for user-replaced values and follow this general format: _<value_name>_.

Ensure that user-replaced values have the following characteristics:

* Surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`)
* Separated by underscores (`_`) for multi-word values
* Lowercase, unless the rest of the related text is uppercase or another capitalization scheme
* Italicized
* If the user-replaced value is referencing a value in code or in a command that is normally monospace, also use monospace for the user-replaced value.

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value in a paragraph

----
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
----

This renders as:

====
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
====

To italicize a user-replaced value in a code block, you must add an attribute to apply text formatting, such as `subs="+quotes"` or `subs="normal"`, to the attribute list of the code block.

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value in a code block

  [subs="+quotes"]
  ----
  $ oc describe node __<node_name>__
  ----

This renders as:

====
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc describe node __<node_name>__
----
====

[TIP]
====
When applying multiple attributes to a block, use the following syntax:

.Example AsciiDoc: Combined source highlighting and substitution attributes

  [source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
====

// TODO: In the future, add alternative guidance for XML

[[lead-in-sentences]]
== Lead-in sentences for `Prerequisites` and `Procedure` sections

A lead-in sentence in this context is the text that directly follows a `Prerequisites` or `Procedure` heading in a task-based module. It is distinct from the module abstract, which describes the goals of the user for the module.

Do not use a lead-in sentence in the `Prerequisites` or `Procedure` sections of a module unless it is necessary to aid navigation or add clarity.

The following examples demonstrate when a lead-in sentence might add value.

* Your module has a long list of prerequisites, and you want to group the prerequisties in sections to make it easier for users to understand what tasks must be performed to complete a procedure.
* Your module has a complex procedure or set of prerequisites, and you want to emphasize that all steps or prerequisites must be completed.

Use a complete sentence for the lead-in sentence to reduce ambiguity and support translation.

[[admonitions]]
== Admonitions

Admonitions should draw the readerâ€™s attention to certain information. Keep admonitions to a minimum, and avoid placing multiple admonitions close to one another. If multiple admonitions are necessary, restructure the information by moving the less-important statements into the flow of the main content.

Valid admonition types:

- NOTE
- IMPORTANT
- WARNING
- TIP

[IMPORTANT]
====
CAUTION, which is another type of AsciiDoc admonition, is not fully supported by the Red Hat Customer Portal. Do not use this admonition type.
====

Admonitions should be short and concise. Do not include procedures in an admonition.

Only individual admonitions are allowed, for example, you cannot have a plural *NOTES* heading.

.Example AsciiDoc
----
[NOTE]
====
Text for note.
